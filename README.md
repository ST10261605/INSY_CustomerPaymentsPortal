# International Payment System: Overview
The international payment system is a banking platform that enables customers to make secure international payments while bank staff are provided with a portal that verifies and processes the transactions through SWIFT.


# System Architecture
•	Customer Portal: a React-based web application for customer transactions
•	Staff Portal: an internet portal for payment verification and processing
•	Backend API: a secure REST API which handles business logic and data persistence


# Security Features
## Authentication and Authorisation
•	Password Security: all passwords are hashed and salted using an industry-standard algorithm
•	Multifactor authentication: authentication for both customers and bank staff
•	Session Management: contains secure timeout policies


## Input Validation
•	Whitelist-based input validation: RegEx patterns are used for all user inputs
•	Server-side validation and client-side checks
•	SQL Injection Protection: using parameterised queries and input sanitisation


## Network Security
•	SSL/TLS Encryption: all traffic is served over HTTPS
•	DDoS Protection: using Rate Limiting and Request Filtering
•	Man-in-the-Middle attack prevention: using a strict TLS configuration


## Attack Mitigation
•	Cross-Site Scripting: has CSP (Content Security Policy) and output encoding
•	Clickjacking protection: using X-Frame-Options and Frame-Ancestors headers
•	Session Jacking prevention: using secure cookie flags and CSRF tokens



# User Roles
## Customers
•	Registration
o	Provide their Name, ID, Account Number and Password
o	All information is validated against banking records
•	Payment Process
o	Login with their username, account number and password
o	Enter the payment amount and select a currency
o	Choose the payment provider (in this case, it’s usually: SWIFT)
o	Finalise with the "Pay Now" option


## Bank Staff
•	Employees are pre-registered only
•	There’s no public registration available
•	Their access is dedicated to the international payments’ portal
•	They verify payee or customer account information and the SWIFT codes
•	The process transactions by clicking the "Verified" and "Submit" 




# Technical Implementation
## Frontend
•	React is used for the Frontend
•	RegEx patterns for input validation
•	HTTPS is enforced
•	Has CSRF token management
•	Has secure session handling

## Backend
•	Using an API
•	Input Sanitisation: all the endpoints validate and sanitize inputs
•	Authentication Middleware: we have a JWT-based authentication
•	Rate Limiting: preventing brute force and DDoS attacks
•	Audit Logging:  tracks all transaction activities


# Database Security
We have the following:
•	Encrypted sensitive data
•	Parameterised queries
•	Least privilege access
•	Regular security audits


# Compliance and Standards
•	SWIFT Compliance: adheres to the SWIFT security requirements
•	Banking Regulations: complies with the international banking standards
•	Data Protection: follows local data protection laws




# Development Requirements
## Prerequisites
•	Node.js (latest version: 24.9.0)
•	Visual Studio Code
•	React (latest version: 19)
•	Secure SSL Certificate
•	Database System

# Security Checklist
Ensure the following is adhered to:
•	All passwords are hashed with salt
•	Input validation is using RegEx whitelists
•	SSL/TLS is enabled on all endpoints
•	XSS protection headers are configured
•	CSRF tokens have been implemented
•	Have SQL injection prevention measures
•	Session security is configured
•	Have DDoS protection mechanisms
•	Have regular security dependency updates


# First Time Setup - SSL Certificate

When you first run the project, browsers will show security warnings because we use self-signed certificates for local development.

## To fix this:

1. *Chrome/Edge*: Click "Advanced" → "Proceed to localhost (unsafe)"
2. *Firefox*: Click "Advanced" → "Accept the Risk and Continue"
3. *Or trust the certificate permanently* (optional):
   - Import ssl/certificate.pem into your Trusted Root Certification Authorities

# Note for Deployment
•	SSL Configuration: ensure valid SSL certificates from trusted CAs
•	Environment Variables: secure storage of database credentials and API keys
•	Firewall Rules: restrict access to necessary ports only
•	Monitoring: implement security monitoring and alerting
